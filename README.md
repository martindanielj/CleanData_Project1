# CleanData_Project1

This repository contains a codebook for the clean data project and a script called run_analysis.R.  This script, if run in the UCI HAR Dataset working directory, will extract, merge, clean, and output a detail dataset called skinnyData, and a summary dataset called samsungData.  It will also write samsungData to a text file that is ready for analysis.
