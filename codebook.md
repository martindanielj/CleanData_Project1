## Clean Data Project - Smartphone Data

### Outline

This codebook outlines the process to clean and tidy a smartphone activity data set.  Included is also the original specification of the data from Smartlab, which is in the next section.  All transforms to the data and modifications will be outlined, as well as a list of the fields in each data set.

### Original Data Definition

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

#### The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

#### For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

All features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

### Transformations to the data

The original data set was provided in two groups: test and training.  It was necessary to piece the groups together.  In addition, the header and subject IDs, as well as activity IDs, were stored in other files (y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt, features.txt).  The first step was getting the header, activity, and subject values into the respective datasets.  Once the information was in place we could then combine the two datasets into one, called mergedData.  

It was also necessary to get the activity names into the dataset, since the activity IDs weren't of much use.  This was done with a merge process against the data from the file activity_labels.txt.  

Since the only measures of interest to this project were the mean and standard deviation values, a second dataset was created having only those values, as well as the subject ID and the activity.  This was done using a grep function to find values that matched our criteria.

A final data set called samsungData was built that held the average feature observation for each activity for each of the 30 subjects.  This dataset has 180 observations of 68 variables.

### Variables in samsungData

The names are similar to those in skinnyData, however, "Average" has been appended to columns 3 through 68.
